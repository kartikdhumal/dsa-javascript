1. Create a simple Promise that resolves after a set timeout.

2. Chain multiple Promises to perform sequential asynchronous operations.

3. Handle errors in a Promise chain.

4. Use Promise.all to run multiple Promises in parallel and wait for all to complete.

5. Use Promise.race to run multiple Promises in parallel and return the first one that completes.

6. Implement a function that returns a Promise and resolves with a given value after a delay.

7. Convert a callback-based function to return a Promise (promisification).

8. Use Promise.allSettled to wait for all Promises to settle, regardless of whether they resolve or reject.

9. Create a function that retries a Promise-based operation a certain number of times before failing.

10. Implement a timeout for a Promise (e.g., reject if it takes longer than a specified time).

11. Use async/await to handle Promises in a more readable way.

13. Create a function that batches asynchronous operations using Promises.

14. Implement a function that processes an array of items asynchronously with a limit on the number of concurrent operations.

15. Use Promise.any to return the first resolved Promise from a list of Promises.

16. Implement a function that cancels a Promise if a certain condition is met.

17. Create a Promise-based delay function that can be used with async/await.

18. Handle nested Promises and flatten the results.

19. Implement a function to handle a sequence of dependent asynchronous operations.

20. Use Promise.resolve and Promise.reject to create immediately resolved or rejected Promises.

21. Implement a function that takes an array of URLs and fetches them in parallel, returning the results as an array of responses.

22. Chain Promises to perform a series of asynchronous tasks and handle the final result.

23. Implement a function that retries a failing Promise-based operation with exponential backoff.

25. Handle rejected Promises gracefully using catch.

26. Implement a function that throttles asynchronous operations using Promises.

28. Use Promise.finally to execute a cleanup action after a Promise settles.

29. Implement a function that handles race conditions using Promises.

30. Combine Promises with different behaviors (e.g., some resolve, some reject) and handle the results appropriately.

31. Implement a function that performs conditional asynchronous operations using Promises.

32. Create a function that resolves with the first successful result from multiple asynchronous operations.

33. Implement a function that chains Promises based on user input or external conditions.
